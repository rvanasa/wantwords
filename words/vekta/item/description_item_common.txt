We got this * for free at an auction because literally nobody else wanted it. 
It ain't the {item}, but it'll do.
{item_adj_common}, {item_adj_common}, and most importantly, {item_adj_common}. 
We have absolutely no idea where this came from. It just appeared in our shop one day. 
It's similar to that {item_common} that {action_past_bad}. 
Only the bravest among us can get more than one use out of this. 
You don't want to know where this * has been...
We're selling this at a discount for many, many reasons. 
This is most likely the worst * in existence. 
Sometimes, if you listen closely, you can hear it shouting insults at you. 
Be careful with this one. 
Watch your fingers. 
(It's very obviously broken)
Probably your only chance to own a *.
It's actually a repurposed {item_noun} {item_modifier}. 
We can't seem to get rid of this thing. 
Why wouldn't you want this *?
Yes, we realize it's a *, but by the same token it's a *!
I bet you could get a good deal for this somewhere...eventually...
We bought this from the sketchlords at {estate_common}. Instant regret. 
A previous space traveler unloaded this one on us. 
Turns out this isn't nearly as useful as you'd expect it to be. Take that as you will. 
All we can say is, it's a {item_adj_common} {item_adj_common} *!
You'll never need a * again after this one.
